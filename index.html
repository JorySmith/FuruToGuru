        <ul>
          <li>
            Your #1 job in trading is to make great trades. And great trades are
            a function of 1) timing and 2) position sizing. Fail to make great
            trades and your account will not survive. So before every trade, ask
            yourself, "Is this a great trade?" If not, don't trade.
          </li>
          <li>
            You gotta do the thing to get good. Practice and review. 1 hour of
            doing is worth more than 10 hours of consuming:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Create a playbook of your best trades, then continuously add
                stock chart examples of each
              </li>
              <li>
                Practice your playbook trades and technical analysis via bar
                replay. Talk it out and write it down. Sit and wait for a
                playbook trade to show up, or a stop or target to hit. Sitting
                is doing (it's patience), and where the big money is made.
              </li>
              <li>
                Create a trade plan. Identify the ideal entry, stop, trailed
                stops, and targets.
              </li>
              <li>Do a pre-trade checklist. No exceptions.</li>
              <li>
                Trade the plan (real or sim), no exceptions. Let the market
                decide entries and exits, not your emotions. Victory in trading
                is just following your plan. Results will follow eventually. Is
                this a perfect entry/exit? No or Don't know? Don't trade.
              </li>
              <li>
                Do an After Action Review (AAR). What'd you do wrong? What'd you
                do right?
              </li>
              <li>Build a massive mental model with thousands of reps</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>Scared to trade? Size down or don't trade. Or sim trade it.</li>
          <li>Pre-trade checklist (doublecheck):</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Is there a news catalyst? Sector theme? Or just TA?</li>
            <li>HTF pattern, pushes, and RT analysis. Write it down.</li>
            <li>
              TTF pattern, pushes, and RT analysis. Aligned with HTF? Write it
              down.
            </li>
            <li>What's the entry/exit price?</li>
            <li>Where's the stop?</li>
            <li>Is this a great trade? A picture perfect entry or exit?</li>
            <li>Position size, shares, contracts?</li>
            <li>Buy or sell options? Or shares?</li>
            <li>DTE, order type GTC 24hrs?</li>
            <li>EOD, Friday/near weekend?</li>
            <li>Major news or economic event soon? Earnings, fed talk, etc.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            The big money is made in the sitting and waiting. Waiting for a
            playbook entry. Waiting for a stop or target to hit. You don't have
            to trade. Relax. Study. Practice.
          </li>
          <li>
            I'd rather be late and right, than early and wrong. Patience pays.
            What do you actually want to see happen for you to get in? To get
            out?
          </li>
          <li>
            Let the market decide entries and exits. Not your emotions. Is this
            entry or exit picture perfect? If not, don't do it.
          </li>
          <li>Know where you're getting out before getting in.</li>
          <li>
            Don't stare at price action and overanalyze. Set alerts near
            entries, stops, and targets.
          </li>

            Biggest drivers of free markets:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Price Context, Especially HTF, then TTF but also overall market
                cycle (bull market, bear, or range)
              </li>
              <li>News, Catalysts, and Sectors in play</li>
              <li>Past Flows, Positioning, Supply v. Demand</li>

          <li>
            Trade with the market, not against. A rising tide lifts all boats,
            and vice versa.

            Don't do this alone. Your environment — especially the people around
            you and the content you consume — can make all the difference
            between success and failure.
          </li>
          <li>
            Diversify your mental health. You will lose a lot in trading. So
            what other hobbies or things can you still get victories today?

            Comparison is the thief of joy. Don't compare your Chapter 2

          <li>
            You can't get better if you don't know what you're doing wrong. So
            do After action reviews to find lessons learned. What'd you do
            right? What'd you do wrong? Make a plan to fix what you did wrong,
            and do more of what you did right.

          <li>
            Missed a trade? No worries, sim trade it for more reps, or wait for
            more info.
          </li>
          <li>Not sure? Don't know? Don't trade. Wait for a better trade.</li>
          <li>
            Worried? Scared? Don't trade. Or size down and let the market
            determine entries and exits.
          </li>
          <li>Where is the next explosive trade level?</li>
          <li>What's a great entry that may fail and trap traders?</li>

          <li>Lessons learned</li>
          <li>Worst Mistakes:</li>
          <li>
            Not doing a pretrade checklist/plan, and double-checking it before
            entry (TA, entry, stop)
          </li>
          <li>Not waiting for RBO entry, emotional entry</li>
          <li>Wrong HTF bias call</li>
          <li>FOMO need to trade even if HTF or TTF is not clear.</li>
          <li>
            Not wanting to miss a big move/FOMO so I overtrade long and short,
            increase size to make up for losses, and lose way more money.
          </li>
          <li>Not waiting for RBO</li>
          <li>
            Not waiting for a RBO, join the trend, or avoid entry RBO that never
            triggers
          </li>
          <li>Not updating UTLs and DTLs every 5 bars</li>
          <li>
            Before entry, not double-checking order, DTE, right contract, near
            EOD or weekend.
          </li>
          <li>
            Not trading with HTF pattern bias on the TTF. Scalp if not, but
            focus should really be on joining the HTF pattern.
          </li>
          <li>Trading too big, emotional, not the chart</li>
          <li>
            Not respecting the stop or trailed stop, stopping out emotionally
          </li>
          <li>Not getting out at stop, being stingy with limit orders</li>
          <li>Not waiting for TTF to match up with HTF bias</li>
          <li>
            Not taking a 2RBO entry over a bad signal bar, especially at a key
            level test
          </li>
