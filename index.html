        <h2>Main Ideas</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Making a bad decision is the greatest problem in trading.</li>
          <li>Don't know? Don't trade. You'll know when you see a great setup. </li>
          <li>Take a picture of this setup. Is it crappy? You don't have to trade. Be accountable.</li>
          <li>Practice daily. Get your reps in. High quality. Real or sim/bar replay. </li>
          <li>Worried? Scared? Breathe. Let stop/targets decide. Size down. Wait for more info.</li>
          <li>What HTF level should you be waiting for?</li>
          <li>What is TTF current trend? Join it or wait for BO close.</li>
          <li>Is this a key level's first touch? It usually holds.</li>
          <li>Should you be waiting for a 2nd entry?</li>
          <li>What are traders doing on CVD? Hitting the bid? Lifting offers?</li>
          <li>Near end of day or Friday? DTE days far enough out? If Friday and the week had a big move, dealers close stock hedges.</li>
          <li>About to trade? Where's the stop? Where are the targets?</li>
          <li>Where is the next explosive trade level? News catalyst story?</li>
          <li>What's the HTF bias based on long trends/pushes/stop?</li>
          <li>What's the HTF bias based on short trends/pushes/stop?</li>
          <li>What's a great entry that may fail and trap traders?</li>
          <li>Have Patience, let stops or targets decide exits, not your emotions, can always get back in</li>
          <li>Set alerts and targets, don't stare at PA, it's toxic.</li>
          <li>Don't trade on your phone or rely on tight limit order, use the laptop and market orders or wide limit orders </li>
          <li>Don't die. Protect what you have. Trade smaller. Stick around.</li>
          <li>After action reviews, lessons learned, what to do less of, do more of</li>
        </ul>
      </div>

        <h2>TA</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Practice daily. Get your reps in. High quality. Real or sim/bar replay. </li>
          <li>Check and Update HTF TTF TA every 5 minutes</li>          
          <li>Trend > Consolidation > Trend Resumption or Trend Reversal</li>          
          <li>TLs are the 3 widest points. Sup/res are most touches.</li>          
          <li>Current trend HTF TTF</li>          
          <li>Major Highs and Lows on HTF TTF. Major levels tend to hold on the first test. </li>  
          <li>Bull and bear TLs on HTF TTF</li>
          <li>Bull and bear Pushes on HTF TTF. Especially 2-3 Pushes.</li>
          <li>Bull and bear Entry locations on HTF TTF</li>
          <li>Bull and bear Stops on HTF TTF</li>
          <li>BO mode, strong trend, weak trend, TR consolidation</li>
          <li>CVD: Buyers lifting offers vs Sellers hitting the bids</li>
          <li>Strong moves and big bars usually get 2nd moves</li>
          <li>Strong moves and big bars leave orders behind.
            They get filled during PBs.</li>
          <li>
            A TL or level fails only with BO closes
          </li>
          <li>Wicks do the damage. Closes tell the story.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="quadrant">

        <ul>    
          <li>Awesome entry idea? What happens if it fails? Big puke to next major level?</li>
          <li>You don't need to be first, you need confirmation and momo, price can explode if you have that</li>
          <li>You don't have to trade. Wait for the market to demand a trade</li>

      <div class="quadrant">
        <h2>Stops and Risk</h2>
        <ul>          
          <li>Have Patience, let stops or targets decide exits, not your emotions</li>
          <li>Bet/lose what on this trade? Including commissions and fees.</li>
          <li>Bet your usual size, don't size up/nightengale, or you will be destroyed by the market </li>

          <li>Set alerts and targets, don't stare at PA, it's toxic and may cause you to not let your stop or targets decide.</li>
          <li>If not using a hard stop and using a limit order stop, 
            make it far beyond price to get out. This isn't the time 
            to be stingy. You're wrong. Get out. Protect what you have.</li>
