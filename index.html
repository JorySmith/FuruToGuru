        <h2>Core Principles</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You gotta do the thing to get good. You gotta show up every day. 
            Get your reps in. Time under Tension is vital to growth. 
          </li>
          <li>
            1 hour of doing is worth more than 10 hours of consuming. 
            Do playbook examples, backtest, plan trade, trade plan (real or sim), and AAR.
          </li>
          <li>I'd rather be late and right, than early and wrong.</li>
          <li>Let the market decide entries and exits, stops and targets. 
            Not your emotions. </li>
          <li>
            Do everything you can to stay in this game. It's all about survival.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you can't trade small, then you definitely can't trade big. 
          </li>
          <li>
           Don't do this alone. Your environment -- especially the people around you and 
            the content you consume -- can make all the difference between success and failure.
          </li>
          <li>
            Diversify your mental health. You will lose a lot in trading. So what
            other hobbies or things can you still get victories today?
          </li>
          <li>
            Comparison is the thief of joy. Don't compare your Chapter 2 progress
            to someone else's Chapter 20.
          </li>
          <li>
            Is this trade picture worthy TTF and HTF? If not, don't trade.
          </li>
          <li>
            Trade well, profits follow. Trade the chart, not your emotions.
          </li>
          <li>
            After action reviews, lessons learned. What'd you see? What'd you do
            wrong? What'd you do right?
          </li>
          <li>Most attention, news, and option volume. Explosive moves</li>
          <li>Making a bad decision is the greatest problem in trading.</li>
          <li>
            Missed a trade? No worries, sim trade it until more info. Get more
            reps in baby
          </li>
          <li>
            You can't get better if you don't know what you're doing wrong. Use
            AARs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Should you be looking to buy or sell based on big picture context
            HTF? Until what level?
          </li>
          <li>Not sure? Don't know? Don't trade. Wait for a better trade.</li>
          <li>
            Worried? Scared? Breathe. Let stops or targets decide, not emotions.
            Size down.
          </li>
          <li>
            Strong moves get 2nd moves unless it's just a PB in a trend.
          </li>
          <li>Practice daily, real or sim. Get your reps in.</li>
          <li>Is this a key level's first touch? It usually holds.</li>
          <li>Should you be waiting for a 2nd entry?</li>
          <li>Near EOD or Friday? DTE days far enough out?</li>
          <li>About to trade? Where's the stop? Where are the targets?</li>
          <li>Where is the next explosive trade level?</li>
          <li>What's a great entry that may fail and trap traders?</li>
          <li>Set alerts and targets, don't stare at PA, it's toxic.</li>
