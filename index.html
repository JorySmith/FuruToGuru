        <h2>Core Principles</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You gotta do the thing to get good. 1 hour of doing is worth more
            than 10 hours of consuming:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Create a playbook of your best trades, then continuously add
                stock chart examples
              </li>
              <li>Backtest playbook</li>
              <li>Create a trade plan</li>
              <li>Trade the plan (real or sim)</li>
              <li>Do an After Action Review (AAR)</li>
              <li>Build a massive mental model with thousands of reps</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Biggest drivers of free markets:
            <ul>
              <li>Price</li>
              <li>Context, News, Catalysts</li>
              <li>Positioning, Past Flows, Supply v. Demand</li>
              <li>Current Flows, Supply v. Demand</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            I'd rather be late and right, than early and wrong. Patience pays.
          </li>
          <li>
            Let the market decide entries and exits, stops and targets. Not your
            emotions.
          </li>
          <li>
            What's HTF bias, context, and news? Write it down. Is this
            entry aligned with HTF bias? No? Or don't know? Don't trade. 
          </li>
          <li>
            Is this entry, stop, or target picture perfect? No? Don't do it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Massive whales wait for key levels, and that level may not even
            hold. Why trade without there help? They might not even be right at
            that key level.
          </li>
          <li>
            Don't go on tilt, size up, and overtrade. You will lose vastly more
            sums of money.
          </li>
          <li>
            About to enter a trade? Where's the stop? How much money are you
            willing to lose?
          </li>
          <li>
            Do everything you can to stay in this game. It's all about survival.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you can't trade small, then you definitely can't trade big.
          </li>
          <li>
            Focus on what you're doing. Cut out the distractions and noise.
          </li>
          <li>
            Trade with the market via RBOs, not against. A rising tide lifts all
            boats, and vice versa.
          </li>
          <li>
            Don't do this alone. Your environment -- especially the people
            around you and the content you consume -- can make all the
            difference between success and failure.
          </li>
          <li>
            Diversify your mental health. You will lose a lot in trading. So
            what other hobbies or things can you still get victories today?
          </li>
          <li>
            Comparison is the thief of joy. Don't compare your Chapter 2
            progress to someone else's Chapter 20.
          </li>
          <li>
            You can't get better if you don't know what you're doing wrong. So
            do After action reviews to find lessons learned. What'd you do
            right? What'd you do wrong?
          </li>
          <li>
            Focus: Most attention, volume, and news or great pattern context.
            Explosive moves
          </li>
          <li>
            Missed a trade? No worries, sim trade it for more reps, or wait for
            more info.
          </li>
          <li>Not sure? Don't know? Don't trade. Wait for a better trade.</li>
          <li>
            Worried? Scared? Don't trade. Or size down and let the market
            determine entries and exits.
          </li>
          <li>
            Strong moves tend to get 2nd moves, less so at key level tests or TL
            BO PB/retracement shakeouts.
          </li>
          <li>Where is the next explosive trade level?</li>
          <li>What's a great entry that may fail and trap traders?</li>
          <li>Set alerts and targets, don't stare at PA, it's toxic.</li>

          <li>Not waiting for RBO</li>
          <li>
            Not waiting for a RBO, join the trend, or avoid entry RBO that never
            triggers
          </li>
          <li>Not updating UTLs and DTLs every 5 bars</li>
          <li>
            Before entry, not double-checking order, DTE, right contract, near
            EOD or weekend.
          </li>
          <li>
            Not trading with HTF pattern bias on the TTF. Scalp if not, but
            focus should really be on joining the HTF pattern.
          </li>
          <li>Trading too big, emotional, not the chart</li>
          <li>
            Not respecting the stop or trailed stop, stopping out emotionally
          </li>
          <li>Not getting out at stop, being stingy with limit orders</li>
          <li>Not waiting for TTF to match up with HTF bias</li>
          <li>
            Not taking a 2RBO entry over a bad signal bar, especially at a key
            level test
          </li>
        </ul>
